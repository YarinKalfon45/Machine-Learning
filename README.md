# Machine-Learning
## ðŸ“š Course Overview

This repository contains all the assignments for the Machine Learning course. The course provides a foundational understanding of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) concepts, models, and algorithms Through hands-on assignments.
The course covered the fundamentals of machine learning  and deep learning , including statistical inference, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, and generative vs. discriminative models,  classical ML techniques (e.g., regression, decision trees , random forests ) and neural networks (e.g., MLPs, backpropagation, SGD, Adam ). Advanced topics include CNNs , RNNs , autoencoders, and adversarial learning.
