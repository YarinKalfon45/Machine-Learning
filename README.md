# Machine-Learning
## 📚 Course Overview

This repository contains all the assignments for the Machine Learning course. The course provides a foundational understanding of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) concepts, models, and algorithms. Through hands-on assignments, students explore a wide range of ML techniques and architectures.

The course covered the fundamentals of machine learning 🤖 and deep learning 🧠, including statistical inference, supervised vs. unsupervised learning, and generative vs. discriminative models,  classical ML techniques (e.g., regression, decision trees 🌲, random forests 🌳) and neural networks (e.g., MLPs, backpropagation, SGD, Adam ). Advanced topics include CNNs 🖼️, RNNs 🔁, autoencoders, and adversarial learning.
